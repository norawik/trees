        "\n",
        "**1. How are trees constructed?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision trees are constructed by first forming a root node with the whole dataset. Then, the algorithms splits the data into subsets, re-evaluating at each node based on a set of criteria (including if the data is correctly allocated based on category/subset).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. How do trees handle non-linear relationships between variables? Compare this to linear models.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Trees are meant to handle non-linear relationships between variables. They split the data and variables based on subsets/criteria. They find non-linear relationships between the indepedent and dependent variables (or features and target variables). Linear models, in contrast, assume a linear relationship between variables and can only find non-linear relationships if feature engineering is used. Therefore, they are limited and are not as good at handling non-linear relationships between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Why is the Gini a good loss function for categorical target variables?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Gini is a good loss function for categorical target variables, as it determines the probability that the variables are misclassified. Therefore, it can determine if when two elements are selected, what are the odds they will be misclassified. This is especially helpful for categorical target variables, as it is helpful to determine the misclassification of homogenous variables, specifically.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Why do trees tend to overfit, and how can this tendency be constrained?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision trees tend to overfit as they learn from the training data too well, meaning that they are more likely to overfit when given test data or new data. They can often include and learn extraneous variables, which can lead to poor generalizations. To constrain this tendency, I could use techniques such as pruning, where you can remove certain nodes to make the tree more simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. True or false, and explain: Trees only really perform well in situations with lots of categorical variables as features/covariates.**\n",
        "\n",
        "False, although decision trees may be more effective at performing in situations with categorical variables as features and covariates, trees can also handle numeric variables and data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Why don't most versions of classification/regression tree concept allow for more than two branches after a split?**\n",
        "\n",
        "More versions of trees do not allow for more than two branches after a split, as if there were more than 2 branches there would be too many options for the next split, that the model may not be able to handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What are some heuristic ways you can examine a tree and decide whether it is probably over- or under-fitting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can examine if a tree is over or underfitting by running the training set and a test set. From here, you can compare the two to see if the model performs worst on the test set due to over or underfitting (such as learning the training data too closely)."
